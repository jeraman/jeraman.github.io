Recent examples such as the Loopy, the Borderlands, the Ocarina illustrate that powerful visual interfaces are capable of captivating amateur and expert musicians alike by making music manipulation more direct and straightforward. However, while successful examples are available, effectively designing such direct interfaces remains challenging, typically proceeding “as more art than science”. For example, unlike acoustic instruments, sound production is physically decoupled from input controls, yielding infinite possibilities for mapping. Moreover, increasing ease-of-use for novices can lead to toy applications that disinterest experts. Finally, analyzing successful crafts remain unusual, and little music interface research is being carried to better understand these interfaces. This thesis attempts to understand these musical interfaces better, aiming at providing empirical evidence to inform their design and evaluation. Borrowing from human-computer interaction research, I hypothesize that one effective strategy concerns adopting an interaction model known as direct manipulation–characterized by continuous visual representation of the object of interest, physical actions to manipulate the visual representations, rapid visual feedback, and incremental and easily reversible actions. To investigate this hypothesis, I report exploratory case studies where direct manipulation is designed and evaluated in three specific contexts of music tools: a) live looping tools; b) tools for creating interactive artistic installations; and c) music authoring tools. As a result, I introduce three novel software music tools: Voice Reaping Machine; ZenStates; and StateSynth. Finally, I present a set of interface design strategies and evaluation approaches for effectively designing direct manipulation in musical interfaces based on visuals.","tags":["PhD","ZenStates","StateSynth","Responsive Environments","End-User Programming","Empowering systems"],"title":"Direct Manipulation for Musical Interfaces Based on Visual Software: Design and Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeronimo Barbosa","Marcelo M.

However, little effort has been made in investigating how these tools support creative communities who typically struggle with technical development. This is the case, for instance, of media artists and composers working with interactive environments. To address this problem, we introduce ZenStates: a new specification model for creative interactive environments that combines Hierarchical Finite-States Machines, expressions, off-the-shelf components called Tasks, and a global communication system called the Blackboard. Our evaluation is three-folded: a) implementing our model in a direct manipulation-based software interface; b) probing ZenStates’ expressive power through 90 exploratory scenarios; and c) performing a user study to investigate the understandability of ZenStates’ model. Results support ZenStates viability, its expressivity, and suggest that ZenStates is easier to understand–in terms of decision time and decision accuracy– compared to two popular alternatives.","tags":["PhD","ZenStates","Responsive Environments","End-User Programming","Empowering systems"],"title":"ZenStates: Easy-to-Understand Yet Expressive Specifications for Creative Interactive Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Hi.

From childhood to adultness, playfulness is often associated with remarkable positive experiences related to fun, pleasure, intimate social activities, imagination, and creativity. Perhaps not surprisingly, playfulness has been recurrently used in NIME designs as a strategy to engage people, often non-expert, in short term musical activities. Yet, designing for playfulness remains a challenging task, as little knowledge is available for designers to support their decisions. To address this issue, we follow a design rationale approach using the context of Live Looping (LL) as a case study. We start by surveying 101 LL tools, summarizing our analysis into a new design space. We then use this design space to discuss potential guidelines to address playfulness in a design process. These guidelines are implemented and discussed in a new LL tool–called the “Voice Reaping Machine”. Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous works.","tags":["PhD","Live Looping","Design","New Interfaces for Musical Expression","Playfulness"],"title":"Exploring Playfulness in NIME Design: The Case of Live Looping Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Steal \u0026amp; Repeat Machine is a live looping tool based on direct manipulation of sound.
