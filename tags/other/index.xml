      <description>The Laboratório de Computação e Arte (LaboCA) was a series of guerrilla workshops introducing artists to creative computational practice in Brazil. LaboCAs resulted from the collaboration between Jarbas Jácome, Ricardo Brazileiro, Filipe Calegario, myself, and many other friends and collaborators. I proudly contributed to LaboCA from 2010 to 2012, when LaboCA finished its activities.
